    <h1>Welcome to Mozilla Firefox</h1>
    <img src="hw1/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="Image of the Firefox logo." />

    <p>Mozilla is an international powerhouse built by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>technologists</li>
        <li>dreamers</li>
        <li>builders</li>
    </ul>
    <p>working as one. We firmly believe that we are stronger together, and at
        the center of Mozilla's mission is a goal of true unity. We feel
        that the better we work together, the more equipped we are to handle
        (and solve) the world's problems.
